# UserScripts

## Bundle Helper

To use this script, click the "Mark Owned" button that appears at the bottom right of the page. Games that you own will be highlighted in green.

To avoid hitting Steam's servers too often, the script caches your [steam profile information](https://store.steampowered.com/dynamicstore/userdata/) locally and refreshes it after 15 minutes. You will need to be logged in to Steam for this request to work

The [Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com) "pick-and-mix" bundle pages may require the [React Dev Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) addon to work correctly

## SteamGifts Giveaway Entry

This script allows you to easily enter all (visible) giveaways on [SteamGifts](https://www.steamgifts.com/).

To use this script, click the "Find Giveaways!" button that appears at the bottom left of the page. The button will change to let you know how many giveaways will be entered. Click the button once more to enter the giveaways.

The script should respect/ignore giveaways that were hidden by [ESGST](https://github.com/rafaelgssa/esgst).
